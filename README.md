## Questions

### Which do you think is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services: Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit?     
I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit is better than Robot Framework because Cucumber framework is highly considered due to itâ€™s simple and user friendly usage, Robot Framework has more of complex structure comparing to Cucumber.
